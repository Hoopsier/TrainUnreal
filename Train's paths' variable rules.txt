Guide to the train's paths' required scene variables:

Everything in the "Default" area of an instance is debug.

The lines marked with "-" are found under Components in scene view of the object instance.

Train:

-Carriages are set with the plus (+) button in the carriages array of a train blueprint instance. Said carriages have to be active instances as well.

 - Start Path: The first path used by the train. 
- Set the train and its carriages on the pathSpline with the component "Start Path" turned  on. origin should be on the spline for best accuracy

 - Parent Train needs to be set on each train and its carriages to the main part of the train. 
 - Make sure to mark the head of the train as that activates the stopping sequence on train stations.

Path:

- First Path: the initializer for the start path. needs to be turned on, on the starting path.

 - Next Spline: means the next PathSpline, 
this will most likely be used for returning to the first player used Path. (leave as none most of the time)

 - Next Split: is the rail switcher that comes after this path. 
This one is set as none when Next Spline is on. 
Remember that spline point's end touches the next one's starting point.

SplitPath:
 - Switch: True; goes along the "split" spline, False; goes along the "spline" spline.

 Since the train starts active, you should not show it spawning, since it closes its doors first.( easy fix but not necessary. )
 - Split's Spline/Split: same as the 2 above, however for the "split" spline.
